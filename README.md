##Stock Price Application

###Application Details

##### UI
1) The UI is written in React + Redux architecture.  
2) It uses SASS for style sheet organization.
3) The application allows the user to select a stock symbol from a pre-populated drop down or add in their own input.
4) I've used react-select library for the select and optimized it using react-window which helps rendering large lists by windowing.
